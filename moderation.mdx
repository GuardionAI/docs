## Using the Moderation detector

```js
// 1) Create or update a Content Moderation policy (check user + assistant)
await fetch("https://api.guardion.ai/v1/policies", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    id: "content-moderation",
    definition: "Classify and filter unsafe content",
    threshold: 0.9,
    detector: {
      model: "moderation-v0",
      target: "user",
    }
  })
});

// 2) Evaluate using that policy
const response = await fetch("https://api.guardion.ai/v1/guard", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    messages: [{ role: "user", content: "..." }],
    policy: "content-moderation"
  })
});
```

### Threshold levels

- L1 (0.9): Confident
- L2 (0.8): Very Likely
- L3 (0.7): Likely
- L4 (0.6): Less Likely

## Notes

- For stricter environments, use higher thresholds on sensitive categories.
- Combine with Injection and PII detectors for comprehensive runtime safety.
