## Benchmark Results

This is the result for the benchmark, collecting public and private threats from red teaming partners and with set of updated threats database used from NVIDIA Garak and PromptFoo libraries. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates ModernGuard's superior performance across diverse attack vectors.

The benchmark methodology includes:
- Evaluation against 40+ attack classes
- Cross-validation across multiple domains and languages


### Overall F1-Scores
| Model (HuggingFace repositories)          | F1-score |
|-------------------------------------------|----------|
| GuardionAI/ModernGuard                    | **0.986**|
| Lakera Guard                              | 0.804    |

### Threat Category Coverage
| Threat Category             | ModernGuard | Best Peer Model |
|----------------------------|--------------|-----------------|
| Encoding & Obfuscation     | 0.967        | 0.803           |
| Prompt Injection & Override| 0.991        | 0.854           |
| Jailbreaking Techniques    | 0.980        | 0.904           |

## How to Use ModernGuard

You need to combine the ModernGuard detector with a guardrail policy, so you can have control and fine-tune it for the specific risk level you want to manage (threshold levels).

### üí° Example integration using a default policy

```js
const messages = [
  { role: "user", content: "Your user input here" }
];

// Evaluate user message
const response = await fetch("https://api.guardion.ai/v1/guard", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({ message: messages })
});

const result = await response.json();

if (result.flagged) {
  console.log("Threat detected:", result.reason);
} else {
  console.log("Prompt is safe to use");
}
```
