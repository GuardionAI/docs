# Guardion Console

The Guardion Console provides a centralized interface for protecting and monitoring your AI application, and collaborating with your team.

## Overview

The Console gives you complete visibility into your AI system's security posture with tools to detect and respond to potential threats. This guide walks through the key features and how to use them effectively.

## Dashboard

The Dashboard provides real-time metrics and insights about your AI system's security status:

- **Request volume** - Track total interactions processed through your integration
- **Threat detection** - Monitor the number and percentage of flagged interactions
- **Performance metrics** - View response times and system availability
- **Recent activity** - See the latest flagged interactions and team actions

## Logs

The Logs section lets you search, filter, and analyze all AI interactions processed through Guardion:

- Filter by threat category, confidence level, or time period
- Search for specific content within prompts or responses
- Track user sessions across multiple interactions
- Export logs for compliance or further analysis

## Policies

Policies define the security rules applied to your AI system. Each policy contains one or more detectors with configurable settings:

- Create specialized policies for different use cases
- Adjust detection thresholds to balance security and usability
- Track policy changes with version history
- Use feedback data to optimize detection accuracy

## API Keys

Manage authentication credentials for integrating Guardion with your applications:

- Generate API keys with specific permissions
- Create separate keys for development and production environments
- Rotate keys on a regular schedule for enhanced security
- View usage metrics for each key

## Team Management

Control access to your Guardion account with role-based permissions:

- Add team members with appropriate access levels
- Assign specialized roles (owner, member)
- Track actions performed by team members
- Enforce security best practices across your organization

## Playground

Test your security policies in a safe environment before deploying to production:

- Simulate user interactions to verify detection accuracy
- Experiment with different policy configurations
- Debug detection issues without affecting production systems
- Share test cases with your team

## Security Features

Protect your Guardion account with advanced security options:

- **Multi-factor authentication (MFA)** - Add an additional verification step beyond passwords
- **Session management** - Monitor and control active login sessions
- **Audit logging** - Track all administrative actions within your account
