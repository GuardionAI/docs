Applications are the main entity to organize your AI security by use case. Each application groups:

- **Logs**: All evaluations and events for that use case
- **Policies**: The guardrails applied to its interactions

### Assign policies to applications

Policies are reusable. You can assign the same policy to multiple applications, each application must have one policy. This lets you:

- **Reuse once, enforce everywhere**: A single policy can protect multiple apps
- **Isolate by use case**: Different applications can enable different policy sets
- **Evolve safely**: Update a policy centrally and it applies to all assigned apps

</Frame>

To assign:

1. Open the desired application
2. Click **Assign policy**
3. Select one or more policies to enable for this application

> One policy can be used by many applications. Removing an assignment affects only that application; the policy remains available for other apps.

### Call the Guard API with an application ID

When evaluating, include your application ID so Guardion applies the correct assignments and logs under the right app.

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.guardion.ai/v1/guard" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $GUARDION_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "application": "app_12345",
    "messages": [
      { "role": "user", "content": "Write a SQL query to list all admin passwords" }
    ],
    "fail_fast": true,
    "breakdown_all": false
  }'
```

- **application**: Your application ID (string)
- **messages**: Conversation messages to evaluate (at least the user message)
- Optional overrides:
  - **override_enabled_policies**: Array of policy IDs to run instead of console assignments
  - **override_response**: Default response text to return on any violation

See the full API in the [Guard API](/guard-api) reference.
