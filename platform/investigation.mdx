The Logs interface is your central hub for monitoring and investigating AI interactions. 
Each log entry contains detailed information about the request section, time, messages and any flags triggered during evaluation.

### Filtering and search

Quickly find relevant requests with these filtering tools:

- **Threat filters** - Focus on specific threat categories or view all requests
- **Full-text search** - Find specific content within prompts or responses
- **Time range** - Narrow results to specific time periods (day, week, or custom)
- **Confidence threshold** - Adjust minimum confidence score to focus on high-probability threats (coming soon)
- **Session ID** - Track specific user sessions across multiple interactions

<Tip>
Use the search function to look for specific keywords that might indicate security concerns, such as "password," "API key," or "database access."
</Tip>

### Log details

Click on any log entry to view comprehensive information about the interaction:

</Frame>

Each log detail view includes:

- **Complete conversation history** - See the full context of the interaction
- **Detection metadata** - View confidence scores and specific policies triggered
- **Source information** - Identify the origin with session ID and client metadata
- **Feedback controls** - Provide input to improve detection accuracy

For interactions that passed all security checks, you'll see a simplified view:

## Providing feedback

When reviewing logs, you can help improve Guardion's detection accuracy by providing feedback on any misclassifications you find:

1. Open the log detail view for the interaction
2. Review the detection results and conversation context
3. If you identify a false positive or false negative, click **Mark as Misclassification**
4. Your feedback is immediately incorporated into the detection system

<Note>
Your feedback helps build a dataset specific to your policy, making Guardion's runtime control more accurate over time. Learn more in our [Feedbacks](/platform/feedbacks) documentation.

## Best practices

- **Regular monitoring**: Schedule time to review logs daily or weekly depending on your traffic volume
- **Investigate patterns**: Look for repeated attempts that might indicate targeted attacks
- **Provide feedback**: Mark misclassifications to continuously improve detection accuracy
- **Set up alerts**: Configure notifications for high-confidence threats (coming soon)
- **Export data**: Use the API to integrate log data with your existing security tools (coming soon)
