# Investigation

The Investigation tools in Guardion provide a comprehensive view of your AI system's activity, allowing you to monitor interactions, identify potential threats, and improve detection accuracy through feedback.

## Logs

The Logs section gives you a detailed view of all requests processed by your AI system, with powerful filtering and search capabilities to help you identify patterns and investigate incidents.

### Filtering options

Narrow down your logs with these filtering tools:

- **Threat category filter** - Focus on specific threat types or view all requests
- **Keyword search** - Find specific content within prompts or responses
- **Date range selection** - Investigate activity within specific time periods
- **Confidence threshold** - Filter by detection confidence to prioritize high-risk interactions

### Log details

Click on any log entry to view comprehensive information about the interaction:

- Complete conversation history between user and assistant
- Detection metadata including confidence scores and triggered policies
- Source information including session ID and client metadata
- Feedback options to improve detection accuracy

## Feedback system

The feedback system allows you to continuously improve your AI guardrails by providing input on detection results. When you identify a misclassification, you can mark it directly from the log details view.

### Benefits of providing feedback

- Immediately adjusts detection thresholds in the Guard API
- Helps build a dataset of edge cases specific to your use case
- Improves model accuracy during periodic retraining
- Reduces false positives while maintaining strong protection

For more details on the feedback system, see our [Detection Feedbacks](/platform/feedbacks) documentation.
