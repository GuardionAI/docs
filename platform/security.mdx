Multi-factor authentication (MFA) strengthens your account security by requiring an additional verification step when you sign in. This helps prevent unauthorized access even if your password is compromised.

## Set up MFA

To enable multi-factor authentication:

1. Go to the **Dashboard**
2. Select **Personal Account** â†’ **Settings**
3. In the Multi-factor authentication section, click **Set up**
4. Select your preferred authentication method
5. Complete the verification process by following the on-screen instructions

Once enabled, you'll need to provide both your password and a verification code when signing in to Guardion.

## Available authentication methods

Guardion supports several authentication methods to accommodate different security needs:

| Method | How it works | Security level |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Authenticator app | Uses a TOTP-compatible app like Google Authenticator or Authy to generate time-based codes | Recommended: Highest security, works without internet connection |
| SMS verification (Coming soon) | Delivers verification codes via text message to your registered phone number | Medium security: Convenient but vulnerable to SIM swapping attacks |
| Email verification (Coming soon) | Sends verification codes to your registered email address | Basic security: Use only when other methods aren't available |

We strongly recommend using an authenticator app for optimal security.
