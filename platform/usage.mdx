- **Total Requests**: The total number of API calls made, irrespective of the number of policies or message content.
- **Total Tokens**: The total tokens processed in your requests.
  - Token calculation is based on the active policies, where each policy evaluates the token count of the message content.
- **Rate Limit**: The maximum number of requests allowed per time period for your account.

## Limits
### Token Limit per Request
- The Guard API processes up to 8,000 tokens per request.

### Rate Limit
- A rate limit of 1000/min means up to 1000 requests can be made within one minute.
- Exceeding this limit will result in an HTTP 429 Too Many Requests error.
