> Jump into our [interactive Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1-hDdm2wDQjn9bMQ1l0g5Sjb67qhH4H9n?usp=sharing) to experiment with real DataFrames.


If you want to test your own policies or experiment with different inputs, you can use the Guardion Playground in the Console.

![Guardion Playground](images/playground.png)

The Playground allows you to:
- Test different prompts against your policies
- See detailed detection results
- Adjust thresholds and settings in real-time
- Experiment before deploying to production

## Prerequisites

* A Guardion API key (get it in the [Console](https://guardion.ai))
* cURL or any HTTP client

## API Key Setup

To use Guardion, you'll need an API key. You can get one from the [Guardion Console](https://guardion.ai).

![API Keys in Guardion Console](images/api-keys.png)

Once you have your API key, you can set it as an environment variable:


## Environment Setup

You can set your API key as an environment variable:


```bash
# Set your Guardion API key
echo 'export GUARDION_KEY="sk-‚Ä¶"' >> ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc
```

## Core Response Fields

* **flagged**: whether any policy is detected
* **breakdown**: per-policy scores & detection summary
* **time**: latency in ms

# Important notes

## üõ†Ô∏è API endpoint

You can use the Guardion API from any HTTP client: Python, cURL, Postman, etc. No SDK is required.

### üîë Authentication

Every request must include an API key in the `Authorization` header:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

You can get access your API Key in the console. [Get API Key in Guardion Console](https://guardion.ai)

## ‚è±Ô∏è Rate Limits

The Guardion API enforces a default rate limit of **1000 requests per minute** per API key.

If you require a higher rate limit, please contact us at [founders@guardion.ai](mailto:founders@guardion.ai) and we‚Äôll be happy to help.
